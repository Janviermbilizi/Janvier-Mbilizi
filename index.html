          Janvier was born in Congo and took refuge in Burundi. He is currently
          living in the United States since April 2017,after being resettled in
          Virginia with his family and then moved to Denver, Colorado. From
          surviving persecution and family separation, the world has given him a
          chance to learn and speak from experience. If it does not kill you, it
          will make you stronger, a motto that has helped Janvier overcome his
          biggest obstacles. Despite all of his negative experiences, Janvier
          received a degree in Geology from University of Burundi and speaks
          seven languages. Janvier is a self-taught computer programmer and has
          a passion for learning more languages, including computer programming
          languages. Today, he works as a Case Manager at Lutheran Family
          Services (LFS) in Denver, Colorado. He strives to support refugee and
          immigrant communities by providing the same services and opportunities
          he was given. He hopes to start his own nonprofit someday that will
          aim to improve the lives of people worldwide. To learn more about me
